# AlgoCameleer -- Deductive Verification of Classic Algorithms, in Cameleer

## Description

This github repo refers to the research project being developed in APDC course in NOVA School of Science and Technology. In it, we will be looking to take a subset of the [OCamlgraph](https://github.com/backtracking/ocamlgraph) library and formally proving it with the help of the [Cameleer](https://github.com/ocaml-gospel/cameleer) tool.
